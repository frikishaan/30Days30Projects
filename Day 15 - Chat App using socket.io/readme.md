# Chat Application using socket.io

The app is a part of my **#30Days30Projects challenge**. The app have a nice UI which shows a notification on user joined and leaved event. Multiple users can join the chat at a time.

The public folder contains the client side stuff while the server side code is in `index.js` file.
